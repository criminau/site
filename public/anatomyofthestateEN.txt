Anatomy of the state

MURRAY N. ROTHBARD is an anarchist author known for his book "The Mystery of Banking" written in 1983.

## What the State is NOT

The state is almost universally considered an institution of social service.
The state is the only organization in society that obtains its revenue not by voluntray contribution or payment for services rendered but by coercion.
(use of jailhouse and bayonnet)

## What the State is

The state is the systemization of the predatory use process over a given territory.
The state has always been born in conquest and exploitation.

## How the State preserve itself

The majority must be persuaded by ideology that the government is good, wise and at least inevitable.
The intellectuals are therefor, the "opinion-molders" in society.
The state offer to intellectuals panoply of prestige and a secure income.
Protection against sporadic criminals and marauders.
If "Ruritania" was being attacker by "Waldavia", the first task of the state and its intellectuals was to convince the people of Ruritania that the attack was really upon them and not simply upon the rulling caste.
An excellent weapon has been tradition.
A conspiracy theory cas unsettle the system by causing the public to doubt the state's ideological propaganda.
Reason is involved more tan in previous centuries new god Science.

## Limits of the State

Bill of Rights.
Judiciary.
Separate power.

The state (the organization of political means) constitutes, and is the source of the "ruling caste", and is in permanent opposition to genuinely private capital.

## What the State fears

The death of the state can come about in two major ways :
(a) a throught conquest by another state, or (b) throught revolutionnary overthrow by its own subjects - in short, war or revolution.
Any way must be used to mobilize the people to come to the state's defense in the belief that they are defending themselve.
War is the health of the state.
Wich category of crimes does the state pursue and punish most intensely - those against private citizens or those against itself ?

## How the State relate to one another

Inter-state relations must occupy much of a state's time and energy.
The developpement of "international law".
Parts of international law were originally purely private. Example are admiralty law and the law mercant "sanctity of treaties" =/= "sanctity of contract".

## History as a race between State Power and Social Power

Exclusive interrelations betwen men are peace - full cooperation or coecitive exploitation.
CrÃ©ative productivity, peacefull exchange and cooperation =/= coercive dictation and predation over those social relation.
Social power (men power over nature) vs State power (coercive and parasitic seizure of his production power over men).

The state has moved into these new areas, to cripple and confiscate social power.

=> education independant from the State !
